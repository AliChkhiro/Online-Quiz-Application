Online Quiz Application
This is a full-stack web application built using Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The project allows users to participate in quizzes and view their scores after completing the quiz.

Acknowledgments:

I selected to work on a project that I saw on a Youtube channel [Daily Code Work] after seeing it there. I did this to put my knowledge into practice.
This project was inspired by a tutorial from [YouTube channel "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkncPVQMFo8&t=14422s"].
